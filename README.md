## Treadmill for Imaging/Stimulation of Head Fixed Mice
  This is a treadmill for use in imaging and stimulation rigs. The design allows the animal to move and relieve stress over the course of a session while maintaining complete stability for clear signal. The treadmill is simple to assemble and was created to address concerns with weight, cost, and space. Most notably, this design accommodates the load-tolerance parameters of a goniometer, thus allowing the whole assembly to be precisely angled to achieve the most suitable field of view.

All components referenced in the assembly instructions below are listed their respective folders (.STL files for 3D printed components and specs/links for hardware).
## ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS ##
### Rotation stage:
- Drill out the threads of the two middle through-holes in the metal base so that they are smooth 1/4-20 clearance holes.
- Use set screws to firmly attach metal posts on both sides of the base.
- Slide the 3D printed treadmill frame onto the base + post assembly.
- Use middle two holes in the base of the assembly to secure the base to the rotation stage/platform with 1/4-20 screws.
### Head fix clamp:
- Slide the two clamps into the channels at the top of the 3D printed frame.
- Secure directly to each mounting post with a screw and washer.
- Adjust distance by loosening the screw, sliding the clamp into position, and re-tightening the screw.
### Treadmill:
- 3D print treadmill component.
- Use tip of soldering iron to set heat-set inserts into holes in the rail guides.
- Securely attach Teflon tape along the middle track and the inside of the adjacent tracks of the treadmill.
- Place LEGO 24-tooth gears in each slot of the treadmill (4 total).
- Fasten the gears in place by threading a LEGO axle through the holes in the treadmill and the gears.
- Assemble LEGO treads, lay two strips (one over each row of gears) and snap them together.
- Lower treadmill onto the assembly (shorter end forward) and secure at desired height using a screw and washer through the slider hole/heat set insert.
